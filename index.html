                <p>"I love Zenergy Fit Lab! Training with April and the rest of the staff has transformed my outlook on working
                    out and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I now feel confident in the gym and I feel empowered by weight
                    training. Working out with the staff motivates me to stay on track and help manage my diabetes. My body
                    has definitely toned up and I feel more confident in my own skin."</p>

            <p>"I lost my eye sight several years ago and working out was something I never thought I would do. When my wife
                introduced me to April and the staff at Zenergy Fit Lab my life completely changed. The staff has always
                been very accommodating to my needs while still pushing me to reach my fitness goals. I now feel confident
                in the gym. I have gained 25 pounds of muscle and feel stronger then ever." </p>

            <p>"Zenergy Fit Lab has been instrumental in helping me meet my fitness goals. I came in weighing over 350 lbs and
                with their encouragement, guidance and support I've lost 120 lbs. Zenergy Fit Lab provided my husband, my
                family and myself with 1 0n 1 training, nutritional planning, massage therapy and much more. I am thankful
                to have them on this journey with me"</p>
